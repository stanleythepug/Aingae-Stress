# Aingae-Stress
Python code for a GSC account of verbal stress in Aingae

The file "learning_Aingae_stress_with_EDGAR.py" is code for a learning algorithm that learns weights and activations for relevant examples to derive Aingae verbal stress patterns in the Gradient Symbolic Computation framework. The algorithm is similar to the one I developed for learning a model of French Liaison (2019. Learning a model of gradient French liaison (with Paul Smolensky and Matthew Goldrick). Proceedings of the Annual Meeting on Phonology, Stony Brook University, October 2019)
The data analysed come from Maksymilian Dabkowski. 2021. Dominance is non-representational: evidence from A’ingae verbal stress. Phonology 38: 611–650.
Also included are spreadsheets in LibreOfficeCalc and also exported from LOC to excel (I'm not sure how well it exported) which show tableaux for the examples learned by the Python file.
